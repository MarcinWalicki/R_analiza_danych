I'm not a series chess player so I don't believe in reading textbooks for chess, as there are engines to analyse your own games and understand plans, and many new articles everyday in the web, reading heavy handbooks for entertainment is not interesting so I prefer to watch videos or just check databases and engines. I like both positional games and tactical games, but I really like games on fire which are race condition games and the result is usually win or lose not to draw.","35","16","3","182320",NA

As a result, they have been allowing abusers to run rampant carrying out their attacks unchallenged. I personally have observed and experienced numerous instances where moderators actively participate in abuse against users merely trying to protect themselves from the abusers.This combined with the company's promulgated efforts to retain users seems to have resulted in a misguided desire ""protect"" new users at all costs.When new users come to the expecting and even demanding ""service"", they're not to be taken to task.Instead of teaching new users when they do wrong, the effort is to molly-coddle them regardless of negativity they bring.As a result the network is likely to breed a caucus of retained users who have never learnt to improve their own behaviour.Sadly I have serious concerns that a once-great network of sites is headed to self-destruction.","1","1","0","79165",NA

Yes, they're stupid because the answer is usually right in front of me 99.9% of the time! (Even if I insist, at first, that it isn't!)One really big peeve I've realized, I dislike it when someone says something is wrong based off of the usage being uncommon. Think outside the box, and a new world of usage may surprise you! (I still haven't the faintest clue if I'm being sarcastic or not with that last bit...? Ah, yes, slightly sarcastic.) I also dislike when people suggest diminishing a nice set of vocabulary just because the words are not used often in today's time. It sickens me when I see this. I love to readI love to writeI love musicI love making [pointless] hobby sitesAnd nothing gets between me and raspberries ;) I've been stuck on writing three different books since I was 17. Keeping that in mind... I know, realistically, I'm probably never going to be an amazing author and will have to die with the dream of being a best-seller still in my head. Thankfully, I have this great interest in web 'design'. I hate using that word, because most people who say 'Oh yeah, I'm totally into web design', are the same people using Dreamweaver or some other WYSIWYG program instead of opening up a trusty notepad-like blank document and getting down and dirty with coding. (Loved-ones say I'm spectacular with assumptions...)Along with making pointless hobby sites, writing amateur poetry (out of a collection, I have only maybe about 5 that I am particularly proud of), and being sick with writers' block, I'm a huge sucker for reading and writing fanfiction. (Go figure, no writers' block there--for the most part.)I tend to make really bad/stupid/careless jokes. (Bad having a multitude of meanings, hence dash word dash... XD)There is more about me that I'd like to share, but I think I've blabbered long enough. You all have a great one!","0","2","0","1579369",NA

I may even write a paper before I finish it, and do everything the wrong way round! I also now work in the daytime as a programmer, harvesting data, hunting for discrepancies and errors, and fixing robots, and by night and on the weekends I study maths.

I've built websites, mobile &amp; desktop applications, browser extensions, web APIs, JS libraries; and am commonly found saying ""If you can sell it, I can build it"".I'm very passionate about self education/improvement, solving non-trival and technically intriguing problems, building what I love, and applying my skills to help others. Computer programming has always been a passionate hobby of mine, and I have been fortunate enough to have the time and dedication to develop my hobby into a career that I very much enjoy.Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn","0","1","0","1502980","https://i.stack.imgur.com/UfxC4.jpg"

If we, the Ukrainians, fail to stop the Russian tanks on our soil, someone else would have to stop them in Poland, Finland, Baltic states, and finally, in your place.While there is no doubt that your country's army can stop the Russians, think if you want to see a burning Russian tank on the lawn in front of your home. Or think whether you want to become a ""collateral victim"" when KGB assassinates someone using military-grade nerve agent in the center of your city.

I loved building things as a welder, but could not see myself doing this until I reached age 65.After my Honorable Discharge in the early 1990s, I used my G.I. Bill to go to school and received my Bachelor of Science Degree in Physics four years later.Using a love of computers since I played on a Commodore 64 at 10 years old and two (2) C++ electives that I had taken in school, I began working in the computer programming field.The recession following ENRON in 2001 left me working at a remedial job for a little over two years while I brushed up on my skills at a local community college in SQL and first learned what the new .NET Framework was all about.I have had the pleasure of working as a Software Developer since 2003.For a short while, I pulled in a little extra income by running a moonlighting business under the name Joe's Welding. Dangerous working conditions and non-paying customers prompted me to sell my mobile welding equipment about the time my son was born.Today, I am exclusively a Software Developer. My language of choice is C#, and I enjoy working with databases.If you care to find me anywhere else, just do a search on my screen name: jp2code","0","0","0","51509",NA

It's great learning something new on Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites every day.Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:JavaScript (by far my most common for my answers on Stack Overflow)HTMLCSSI've started off learning Python - it's slightly different to JavaScript but so far it's been surprisingly easy to use.I find PHP rather horrid -- it's just too big of a mess to deal with and I abhor the giant blob of functions.  I wouldn't even recommend it for a newbie - not only is it rather dissimilar to other languages, you have to spend half your time reading the PHP manual to figure out what a method does, which cuts down on productivity and learning significantly.Having said that, some of the languages I'm learning now or considering to in the future are:LuaC#Racket(and if this doesn't take a decade) HaskellI've moved to HK just recently, originally from Sydney, Australia.Top 13 on Stack Overflow Reputation of Young Users","0","1","0","2052845","https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYEHR.png"

My solutions can be found at  (https://fnd.io/#/us/software-developer/691659816-tommie-carter). I am  a traditionally trained software engineer with experience building  solutions for international law firms and other organizations. I care about   my products because they bear my name.    ""I have gone through the fire and I am amazing.""    For more, please visit www.tommiecarter.comWhat am I doing on SO?  I attempt to leave the site and our world just a little better than I found it, I try to give complete solutions in each question or answer that I put forward.Why I contribute to SO?  I believe that each of us has a tiny spark of the divine. It is up to each to make a choice to be better than what others say we must be. We can change our world when we do so. Nota Bene  In each of my answers and questions I try to give a complete (non-trivial) solution. Please review these for a comprehensive breakdown of the issue/resolution.

The majority of my career has been web applications and services using ASP.NET MVC (incl. Web API) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) in tandem with database technologies such as Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, and Apache Solr (Lucene). I also spent several years working with less common .NET technologies such as legacy Windows Forms, current-generation Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and the Silverlight browser plugin.I am especially interested in the .NET Framework's unique performance characteristics, due to factors like automatic memory management, type safety, and reliability guarantees; further, I study practical high-performance design techniques such as parallelization and caching. Historically, developers have been able to ignore performance, but the advent of the cloud has changed things. Often, leveraging the cloud means taking a given task and breaking it into sub-tasks that can be processed at different speeds organically. That division of labor necessitates a better understanding of any given operation's cost. As a result, I find that my performance expertise is getting called upon more and more by my employer.","0","2","0","171596","https://i.stack.imgur.com/ie88D.png?s=128&g=1"

On one hand we should be simple, keep an open mind, be flexible, live for the present instead of what have pasted or haven't come. On the other hand we have to do the right thing, be ourselves, keep discipline, learn from the past and plan for the future. These advice contradict each other, aren't actionable when you get lost, and once acted they are perceived as extremes despite the intention of having a balanced and joyful life. If they aren't get wrong, they will go in one ear and out another, or be easier said than done.I have found out an answer for myself for this frustration, perhaps you will find it interesting too?Making concrete analogies and big picturesStraightforwardness, Fearlessness and Improvisation: How to find the fresh perspective?Old introFrom the bottom of my heart, I truly appreciate the community that spending time helping me, a random internet guy, from numerous questions. I just feel pity that I'm still young, have no time and knowledge, to pay back to you. Some day, when I grow up, I will do something for this world. I don't know what that is, but you won't be disappointed for helping me today.","0","0","0","3908836",NA

You can see my webpage on IM-UFRJ here.My area is Geometry and Topology. Specifically, I studied the free loop space of globally symmetric spaces and its homology in the specific case of CROSS's (Compact Rank One Symmetric Spaces) in my MSc. Today, I am leaning towards symplectic topology and Floer homology, expecting to hopefully come up as unscathed as possible from the process of scavenging for references on the subject.My main interests reside in the following areas:TopologyGeometryAnalysisSet TheoryFoundations of MathematicsAlgebraFunctional AnalysisMeasure TheoryI also like music, and I'm a huge fan of guitarist John Frusciante.I have a blog, on which I post something every once in a millennium: http://aloiziomacedo.weebly.com/I have a Real Analysis book in development (mostly done), which you can see here (I've been adding some things, so the last sections are still incomplete).You can contact me at aloiziomacedo AT gmail DOT com.","0","0","0","528142","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0cfbdd85dff4f07c26634e675dec02f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

Hmm, I guess there's little else to discuss.  Unfortunately openings are not 'real' chess, are they?  I'd rather just play a game.  If somebody talks about us playing such-and-such opening after the event, I usually respond with something like ""That's interesting, but I did not know what opening we played"".  There's nothing wrong with a little white lie I suppose, and I don't mean about not knowing the name of the opening.If they don't get the message they might continue with hypothetical questions about alternative moves and potential parallel universe positional outcomes of the game.  That usually leads to a response like ""but we didn't make those moves, no it's not interesting to talk about these things, I played the game I wanted to play, not all possible other games simultaneously. I don't want to rewind and explore other avenues of possibility, that's just speculation about stuff that didn't happen.""A brave adversary at this point might say ""You're no fun to talk to"".To which I would reply ""but I am fun to play, yes?"" and start setting up the board for another game.","12","4","0","14881","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/55af02ec22fd4005261ed2088534f194?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

I have since also gained a grasp of basic HTML - and a little SQL.For a number of years I've been interested in learning C or Visual BASIC, even Delphi (due to its roots) - and am recently set on C# - I am using YouTube for the purpose of self-learning but to say that I have a basic grasp would be wild optimism on my part.Areas of game development that I am interested in include:Game MechanicsPseudo Intelligence (AI)World BuildingDigital Weirdness (code is liberty)What I hope for:Learning C# (possibly more) without being a burdenTo code a few cool gamesTo not give up againNo, I don't wish to be a lone wolf but neither do I feel that my projects have any more worth than anybody else's.

When learning a new programming language, I start with a familiar problem and try to learn enough of the new language to solve it.  For me, an engine for solving genetic algorithms is that familiar problem.  Why?  For one thing, it is a project where I can explore interesting puzzles, and where even a child's game like Tic-tac-toe can be viewed on a whole new level.  Also, I can select increasingly complex puzzles to drive evolution in the capabilities of the engine.  This allows me to discover the expressiveness of the language, the power of its tool chain, and the size of its development community as I work through the idiosyncrasies of the language.","0","1","0","36049",NA

I was an atheist for an intense but rather short while, then drifted back to the newer religions, like neopaganism. In my early University years, I read Nietzsche voraciously, and I was provided with the most profound anti-Christian reasons that ever existed, and that even most atheists and anti-theists remain oblivious toNevertheless at some point, and for some reason, Christianity as such became an attraction to me, almost an aesthetic point of focus that I constantly came back to but was not entirely comfortable with. In fact for a long time, I lapsed back and forth, and even now, though with some consistency, I still lapse back and forth between being a serious orthodox Christian and being merely philosophically Christian. In any case, first Dostoevsky and later Kierkegaard, but also Chesterton and Girard, became my focus points for a slow return back to Christianity. I am still a very incomplete Christian, in practice especially, and in philosophy. I am outside of a denomination, although I seem to identify mostly with Lutheran Christianity, especially in terms of ecclesiology, but hope to obtain a more Patristic outlook as well, and give Orthodox theology a fair hearing.","0","0","0","3763520","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7cd434ff9ea7f989df49689fcd0a298?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

Pour moi, la seule raison d'étudier les mathématiques c'est les propriétés intéressantes entre les nombres. Noter ici que ça emmene a la recherche sur presque toutes les mathématiques. Par exemple, la démonstration de Wiles emploie la méthode et des courbes elliptiques et des représentations galoisiennes. Je reve du jour ou l'on étendra les résultats dans la théorie des extensions abéliennes sur un corps, a savoir la théorie des corps des classes.Néanmoins je sais bien sur qu'il y a encore beaucoup d'autres façons de faire de la recherche en mathématiques, et je suis aussi intéressé par les apprendre. Donc merci pour tout avis.  Ich liebe die Mathematik, besonders die Zahlentheorie. Der einzige Grund, die Mathematik zu betreiben, sind mir die interessanten Beziehungen unter den Zahlen. Dazu muss man fast alle Mathematik studieren. Zum Beispiel, Wiles benutzt die Methode der elliptischen Kurven und der Galois-Darstellungen in seinem berühmten Beweis. Ich träume von einem Tag, wenn man die Ergebnisse in die Theorie der Körpererweiterunen, d.h. Klassenkörpertheorie,  erweitert.Jedoch weiß ich natürlich, daß es noch andere Ansätze zur Mathematik gibt, und ich bin auch interessiert sie zu lernen. Deshalb vielen Dank für jede Meinung.

Focused on front-end currently, but working in a company with lots of proprietary frameworks it tends to mean more focus on requirements honing and working directly with product. I do not work in machine learning but do have the responsibility of delivering massive amounts of data to our customers across visualizations and giant, configurable reports. I do interviews too and often train people for technical interview prep as a hobby (i.e. not for hire, not endorsed by my parent company, not with any structure or rhyme or reason, but happy to help). I am most familiar with Java and Javascript and aspire to learn C++ as done at Google, and Python.I am also a part time masters student at Columbia studying computer science, with a likely focus on Machine Learning.Being engaged: I aspire to be an approachable person politically but will admit I have found a lot to oppose in our new president :) so I focus on training progressives to engage in constructive political dialogue, including such forgotten skills as ""listening,"" ""not calling people racist when you don't know what else is wrong with their viewpoint"" and so forth. I get plenty of practice with my own family and some of my peers! But really, we went astray with trolling Internet arguments and shouting matches at family gathering. Black lives do matter, but I personally can forgive someone if they need to sit down and talk about why and have some, ahem, skeptical questions.Misc hobbies: Aspiring rock climber. Mostly I complain about my climbing gym but have great access to Central Park and have followed in the Gunks. I believe in productivity-as-a-hobby and focus on writing, messing around with bullet journals, etc.","3","4","0","1413944",NA

Is not it amazing? Thanks a lot to creators of Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, Super User, AskUbuntu and others. Thank you so much elder and young people for your participation, helping answers and important questions.I have been working as a software engineer since 2000. It is mostly embedded application developing. I often write or modify/port device drivers. All projects I was involved in I worked at low level programming with deep digging to a hardware specification. I managed with inner mechanisms of a number of RTOSes.I am a Software Engineer at  Topcon.Linkedin profile.Stack Exchange profile.My story of engineering started with my first program that I had written at the age of eleven (11) years old. That was a little arcade game in pseudo-graphic written in Basic, based on ZX Spectrum compliant machine. The same year, in 1991, I realized importance and advantages of coding in Assembler, so I learnt Z80 Zilog's assembler instructions set and got my experience with it. From the 1998 I started working with microcontrollers at university lab, which was a mix of ASMs and C/C++. To sum up, I coded in a variety assemblers and architectures such as x86, Motorola HC08, AVR Atmega, PIC and ARM-7. From 2003 till now I have been working with C/C++ mostly as embedded engineer.There were a several periods I worked with VHDL for ALTERA and XILINX FPGAs. Then I had my expertise with RTOSes (uC/OS-II, RTEMS). I also had a big experience with low-level developing like device drivers, data buses, protocols an so on. A number of drivers I have written from scratch, such as I2C, SPI, CAN, FAT, USB mass storage class. During the last years there were many chips I write support for, such as EEPROM, LED controller, battery charger/monitor, Ethernet PHY, variety of tiny I2C chips with different functions.None of zeros and ones has suffered at writing this autobiography :P","0","0","0","4218427","https://i.stack.imgur.com/VSZSg.jpg?s=128&g=1"

Ask them on Stack Overflow (or wherever they best fit) – if I stumble upon them, I might answer.I was a Moderator Pro Tempore (= until the first elections) at Cryptography Stack Exchange for about three years. Feel free to come around and ask some cryptography questions.My personal name is spoken as /'pawlo/ (IPA), in English this would be written similar to Powlo, I think (i.e. the vowels are ow and o), with an accent on the before-last syllable (which is the first in this case). It's the Esperanto form of my given name. The photo shows my shadow, taken at night. My camera sometimes seems to forget all the other frequencies and only stores the green ones.Some more links:I created an github repository where I'll add interesting code created for responses here.I created Javadoc for JSch - i.e. I read most of the code, thus I now also can answer some JSch-related questions.I got a Job with StackOverflow Careers, and my company's technology department (where I work) has now its own website/blog.","0","0","0","295869",NA

I am a Texas native, returned home to San Antonio a few years ago. Outside of Texas, I lived ten years in Pennsylvania, six years in California and five years in Maryland. I went to school at Texas A&amp;M University, where I earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and later a MS in Computer Science. I worked in the bay area during the peak of the dot-com bubble, which was really exciting, but didn't lead to fame, fortune and an early retirement. I also worked for the U.S. Navy for 10 years as a civil servant in defense acquisitions. There I worked on control systems, simulations and real-time software for unmanned ground vehicles, missile systems and an unmanned air vehicle. Most recently, I worked at Rackspace for almost 3 years, where I was developing web applications with JavaScript, Express, React, Docker and a bunch of AWS cloud technologies. I currently work for HEB as a Senior Software Developer, using Java Spring and Angular. Hobbies include playing/teaching chess and occasionally fumbling my way across a golf course.","0","0","0","5352491",NA

The site is like an either-or question ""game"", where you can vote for all sorts of hypothetical, strange and funny questions. It has a comment plugin for users to discuss the various questions. I'm trying to make the engine intelligent so that it presents only the types of questions that the user finds interesting. Currently it's only in Danish, but I plan to eventually launch an English language version.Besides that I created a linq samples site (http://linqsamples.com) a few years ago. It has linq code examples in c#, vb.net and f#, showing both lambda and query type expression syntax.Although I think Angular is great, my next project will probably be in vue.js, as it looks like a cool scripting language.","0","0","0","4292886","https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgOsF.png"

(Cloud Atlas)  Algumas regras para a vida:      Questione a autoridade.  Nenhuma ideia é verdadeira só porque alguém diz que é, incluindo eu.  Pense por si próprio, questione a si próprio.  Nao acredite em algo só porque quer acreditar, acreditar em algo nao o torna verdadeiro.  Teste ideias pelas evidencias adquiridas, pela observaçao e experimentaçao.  Se uma ideia prevalecente falhar num teste bem desenvolvido, esta errada. Supere.  Siga as evidencias onde quer que elas levem, se nao houver evidencias, evite julgamento. E talvez a regra mais importante de  todas:  Lembre-se, voce pode estar errado.  Neil deGrasse Tyson","0","0","0","4890190","https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4FrL.jpg?s=128&g=1"

Additionally I have pretty good programming skills in Python, Java, C# and Bash; basic skills in JavaScript, HTML+CSS, C, C++, Scheme, Basic, etc...  You can easily contact me in the Ask Ubuntu General Room or the Teenage Programmers Chatroom, as I at least have a quick peek in there most days. I also play chess, so feel free to send me a lichess.org challenge.PS: My profile picture is derived from ""Wolf Tribals"" by user HaskDitex (DeviantArt.com), which is under creative Commons 3.0 License.Currently I'm using the character ""Dregg Morriss"" from the game ""Medieval Cop"" by Vasant Jahav (""Gemini Gamer"").

Mr. Mundi (we just call him ""Monday"") sometimes concentrates too hard, and so it is difficult to get him to pay attention in class.  My dad made this sign to help Mr. Mundi pay attention.  Really, I think ""Monday"" is sleeping in class.  I'm older now and stuff, so I don't need ""Monday's"" help much anymore.  But, I'm holding up the sign here, at the philosophers stack, because the questions asked in Wednesday's seminars (here at the Baptist Church Homeschool) are too difficult for me to answer.  I like the answers I get here, even though my mom says, ""...they are convoluted.""  My dad says that I was born on the Ides of March (he says the 13th, but it is really the 15th), and that I ""...can do philosophy pretty well.""  I tell him it is easy because it is 'right brain' and stuff more than 'left brain' (mathematics).  This is basically what I mean in my question regarding 'neurophysiology.""  I'm the way I am because of my ""brain juices.""  This is what my dad says, anyway.  He says that I should, ""...just exercise discipline.""Recently, I won an award on Yahoo.com for best writer.  It has about 1000 words and stuff.  Well, I wrote about my little sisters--Darley and Daley--misadventures in Hakeim Abeeb's (a Muslin neighbor of ours) backyard.  Hakeim built a model (a concrete block house) of the Kabbah in Mecca on the grassy lot adjacent to his house.  My dad says, ""He doesn't even own the lot.""  But, the city says its ""OK.""  Hakeim keeps old garden tools and lawnmowers in his special Kabbah.  My little sisters know about the Kabbah, so they went over there to ask him about this.  My dad says, ""They had their hands on their hips the whole time; Darley was pointing with her finger, most of the time; Hakeim never took his hands out of his pockets.""  Well, my little sisters came back with a story about 'Golden Showers' and moving rocks and stuff.  The rocks moved by themselves.  Explain that!  It' a real true story.Et puer parvulus minabit eos.  This is what my cousin and teacher, Dallas-Rey says of me.  She thinks that I'm G&amp;T (gifted and talented), but I think she is the really gifted one (but she is much too humble to admit it).  Dallas-Rey is boyish (she loves all sorts of sports and stuff).  But, my dad says, ""..she's a man's girl"" (all her friends are men; she pals-around with the best oldest boys and men and stuff)... and she's way young and a recent college grad.  She is like so beautiful and a big tennis player and serves as our physical education director.  She is also my ""Communicating with Modern Man"" facilitator and helps coach me with the philosophic and theologic stuff.My favorite line from Shakespear?

I started when I was 14, and stopped when I was 17. At my last year of playing chess... I played a simultaneous exhibition game against GM Predrag Nikolic, who after the match rated me at 2100. I was never able to actually get my real rating due to my studies and style of life... But playing chess was probably the best thing I've done in my life.I will try my best to help people learn about chess and I'll answer any question I can answer.","28","8","0","5872573","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0392db96d83b0aefe03e6fa6f6cc2713?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

It is easy to write code with a specific environment in mind, not so easy to write code which should work on a wide variety of systems and non-systems. C got old quickly, C++ a sharp tool on the rack. But with the rise of C++11 I felt the urge to start a quest for alternatives. Re-Re-visiting haskell right now. Sometimes it can really produce astonishingly fast code. But the library situation is terribly fragmented. Why is not everything as good as .NET framework?! I will keep digging deeper this time. After all, it is a good high level language for code targeting not only Windows... Speaking of Windows: -fLLVM did not really work for me... in spite of doing all the web guides asked me to do :(In contrast, Erlang looks very pragmatic and worth having a closer look at. Always liked actor model and message passing style concurrent programming.My latest discovery in my quest to find a worthy C++ 98 successor for embedded programming with style is RUST. Great as an idea but unfortunately not yet on a mature enough level. Don't like cargo and that idea of a package manager, don't like java-style enforced directory structures, don't like the idea of ""whatever you find in the internet is your standard library"" as it will create problems when really trying to port code to a constrained embedded system. I would prefer a set of profiles - like Ada has and conforming ""standard libraries"". Why not define profiles such as ""BareBone Embedded, Embedded, Kernel/Driver, Application"" and allow people to tag their crates with that and some check if the claimed profile is met?","0","0","0","2564721",NA

And I am registered in my death certificate as. . . Oh sorry, in my birth certificate as Nitish Andola. Friends Often Also Call Me as Andy.I hate people who act over smart.. I don’t take lot of time to adjust with anybody..It’s My Strength Rather. I don’t underestimate anyone.I love to live with my friends and for friendship I don’t consider their any previous achievements. I love all those who feel comfortable with me and who make me feel comfortable with them… I always think positive–> Which have never helped me to achieve anything, but still it has become a habit. I forgive people soon, as I feel this life as too short and have no time to keep on proving others as wrong and we the only perfect! I love innovative things. And often Call me as HiFi. I love to be Honest. And one thing I have observed about myself is,I don’t go behind famous people, as it would be an extra burden to them. I don’t like to disturb anybody I enjoy the company of people who are FREE. I too love to live freely! I am always found stuck with computer. And it’s my Passion. I always want to be a successful Ethical Hacker.I believe that people won’t understand the importance of the other person until that person is found dead. And I am not an important person, can you guess Y ? buddu…. because……………I am still alive.I respect each and every person on this earth. I like to be a free spirit. Some don't like that, but that's the way I am.I Love each and every person on this earth..and in very rare cases people get confused about the colour of my Love… For those who doesn’t like me, I don’t have any comments, because its their life and I am no one to poke my nose.. And for those who hate me….hope I am not soooo bad. I never think bad for anyone….etc!I guess, you are my friend..Because you read until here, soooo long. Do you know…. Friendship isn’t about…whom you have known the Longest….who came 1st or who Cares the Best…Its all about Who came and Never Left and I am one of those kinds.I love animals a lot…..in zoo. But some of my friends prefer to live in Home. hahah..Oops, Sorry .I know, its a bad joke!","0","0","0","4810219","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/065cc3e18ea11be95c2618b5f2d0ce2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

I eventually got my own computer and used it for gaming. My father and I talked a lot about computers and Linux (he was big into it in the late 90s and early 2000s) so I learned about linux but never used it.  At the age of 11 I picked up HTML and moved quickly through CSS, Javascript, and started working in various other languages soon after. I became adept at Python programming and involved with a community of people who were developing packages Bodhi Linux and, consequently, aligned myself with a group of people involved in network/systems administration and learned a great deal from them. At about the age of 13 I bricked my computer by tampering with the BIOS on the board. On my new computer I moved rapidly through the operating systems and have settled out on Lubuntu and Arch Linux as my preferred OS's. I made many of my own mods for TES Oblivion and several OpenGL applications in Linux for myself.Now, 18, I work on a large array of projects mostly involving C# and Python. I am preparing enlistment in the US Air Force (hopefully systems administration or cyberspace network administration) and when I get out I plan to apply at RedHat Enterprises. In addition, I am an avid chess player, magic the gathering player, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player* in my free time. My chess elo averages 1800*I also play Shadow Run and Star Wars RPG","0","0","0","3863575","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/973654cb8a1f26fad02a53a4bba0b8a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

My earliest memory was sitting down in the library behind an Apple IIe with a book about BASIC programming, and slowly typing in each line, until the computer asked me my name and responded back after entering it. That was in elementary school and I've been hooked ever since.Front-end web development is my current focus. I'm very comfortable with HTML, CSS, Sass, and jQuery. I'm enjoying Bootstrap and looking into Gumby, Node.js, and Angular.js. I use Git to manage all my source code. I've coded in a LAMP environment and worked in the CodeIgniter framework.I'm extremely comfortable in Linux and have a knack for teaching and guiding people towards discovering the same enjoyment I get from technology. My first distro was Redhat 4.0 in highschool, but my first exposure to a unix shell was at a much younger age (many thanks to RedBarn Data Systems.) That exposure is actually what drew me to Linux. I lived the BBS scene and ran Utopia BBS of Winston-Salem. I remember having to collect IPs and phone numbers, slip/slurp, and the awesomeness that was Archie and Gopher. :) ","0","0","0","5130639","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-181G8lEkc_I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACzY/72EgT3BxjzU/photo.jpg?sz=128"

I would prefer over any other job to find work in programming, but I have the chicken-egg problem.  No experience, so no offers.  I love C# most of all, am learning ASM and fighting my way through many frustrations with it, and often model projects in Python first, use it as my road map when building it in C# or ASM for speed.  I have programmed in C++ (wrote an implementation of Pollard Rho in C++ and posted it here on Stack Overflow under a different account a few years back for example), but the lack of vowels and the surplus of underscores and other punctuation has really soured me on it.  What in the world is a Decklespeck anyway?  Oh wait.  IFNDEF Decklespeck DEF Decklespeck ENDIF.  Whew that was helpful!  LOL!  Oh well, don't get upset.  I realize C++ is a fantastic language.  I just never did wrap my head around that one so well.So anyway, yeah.  C#, ASM, and Python are my big 3.  Behind those are Java, Visual Basic and HTML which I realize is not an actual language.  For all my bashing it, I will probably try C++ again, and will likely learn Javascript at some point as well.","0","0","0","2279831","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/477b229d748952ddd7c36c08b6f86dd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

When ASP.NET MVC came out, I felt I had a good advantage, and had would have a stronger knowledge than if I had continued using 'classic' ASP.NET webforms.I enjoy the fact that stackoverflow is more community based than Experts Exchange, which really makes users feel isolated.I answered more questions in the first two months, than I did in five years at Experts Exchange.Initially spurred on by the challenge of ""doing better than Jonathon Bolster"", I found that helping out is extremely enjoyable and helping people of all technical skill levels is great fun.Please note that I am not currently looking for further employment. :)You can request proof of my identity using my Keybase proof.Stalk me:TwitterInstagramPinterest (used to document my love of steampunk and tattoos)Tumblr (used to document my love of steampunk and tattoos)Facebook (inactive)","1","0","0","15096",NA

I dislike Java, but I'll use it if I have to. Ambivalent towards .NET. Baffled by Pyth and CJam. Intrigued by Brainfuck.I'm creating Seriously, a programming language that looks like Perl, acts like CJam, and will (hopefully) win a lot of golfs. I'm only slightly regretting using almost the entirety of CP437.Speaking of CP437, I've created a website that allows you to enter CP437 (and lots of other encodings!) text by clicking buttons. It's really nice. Ok, not yet, but I'm working on it.I do my best to keep an eye on the solutions to my challenges and keep the accepted answer updated. If I ever miss one, feel free to give me a shout in The Nineteenth Byte.-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----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-----END PUBLIC KEY-----Verification:The following is a base64-encoded signed message containing my PPCG.SE profile URL: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","0","15","0","2927268",NA

My goal in my life is to come up with an algorithm that solves the Artificial General Intelligence problem (there is a bit of obscurity in the actual definition of this term. Here I refer to the actual Human-like intelligence). I believe that AGI can be solved (without requiring extreme computation power. I.e., with the average computation power we have today) by searching for the solution a little different than it is usually done. I believe, the best way to know About-me is to look at my code: My github links: https://github.com/Aplokodika, https://github.com/sreramkThe biggest problem I face when thinking about AGI  The hardest part about trying solve AGI is, thinking about the human  brain's functioning is a bit too frustrating, and exploring any  potential end-point makes us feel that there could be no answer to  this problem. I would describe the human brain as a ""super recursive  machine"" that let's us think about thinking, and above all, every part  of it is too interconnected and dynamic that one isolated piece of  information in one isolated area could be responsible for altering  another piece of information in a completely different area/domain.  Also, it is a complicated equilibrium system, where every part of it  is responsible for maintaining a persistent experience. My say on AGI:  Most methods formulated today are highly optimized for pattern  matching, at an abstract scale. Any complex corpus of information can  be classified by taking their most common pattern, as a representation  of a particular class. Therefore, every piece of data that contains  that pattern is referred to by a class name. These ""unsupervised  learning"" mechanisms which fine-tune it's pattern classification comes  furthest in solving the problem, when compared to all the other known  algorithms.     Eg., Works like Alpha Go, rely on ""rebuilding"" their assertion to  different situations by relying both on a unsupervised algorithm that  stores associated rewards to each situations (which are represented as  abstract patterns in a DNN), and use that knowledge to explore the  solution space more efficiently. This mechanism is also Turing  complete.       I believe, all these methods are still only optimized for solving  problems that involve pattern matching. But AGI is further than just  pattern matching.I'm still in college, doing my BE computer science degree. I have started implementing my algorithm, and I'm putting in all my effort (free time) in trying to finish it. I'm building this algorithm from scratch, in C++, and later I would use Cython to bring it into the Python world. I hope it works, if it doesn't, OH well... I'll cook up a newer hypothesis and I would try implementing that!.","0","0","0","4409278","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/943b6ad928dbb6548e299b0f8b96fed0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

For most of that life I have brought things from my imagination into the real-world, or as some more colloquially express it: I have written software.  For me this has always meant more than compiling, linking, and debugging.  Software permits us to tackle problems that simply cannot be addressed in any other way owing to complexity, evolving understanding, and urgency.  And therefore developing software and doing it well is of paramount importance in the modern world.  Beyond the intellectual challenge what I find intriguing is the deep connections among not obviously related things this activity brings, along with a deeper understanding of how things work and in the course of the endeavors how people who do what I do work.Over the years I have developed and applied my talents in a number of areas including embedded systems, robotics, data analysis, communications, aviation, manufacturing, energy, law enforcement, and business.  I am always looking for the next interesting problem to solve.","0","1","0","3437945","https://i.stack.imgur.com/he5ME.png"

I've used LaTeX since 1991, ever since I wrote a couple of working papers with an early version of LaTeX. I continue to use LaTeX for my own working papers, journal articles, and some of my other professional publications. I am the principal author of the selnolig package, which lets users automatically suppress typographic ligatures that are inappropriate because they span morpheme boundaries, for both English and German language texts.I once edited an entire conference proceedings volume in LaTeX. This was a fabulous learning experience, especially as I got to work closely with a professional book designer from a very early stage of the editing and publication process. For another organization I used to work for, I wrote a LaTeX package to implement the style and layout requirements the organization had chosen to impose on working papers written by its professional staff (mostly its economists). This package (i) helped free up much of the authors' time that would otherwise have been wasted on figuring out how to implement the organization's stylistic requirements in LaTeX -- the guidelines had been written (unsurprisingly...) primarily for users of MS Word -- and (ii) actually convinced some of the organization's economists to make the switch from MS Word to LaTeX in order to write their working papers more efficiently.Welcome to TeX.SE![I've just been asked to write a minimal example.

You're the best!I like Go, as a statically typed C-style-OOP systems programming language, but it doesn't have generics, and doesn't encourage functional practices. D encourages functional programming, proper OOP and fixes the problems of C and Go while being a better C++, and more productive / less dumb than Java.While I love Python, it feels too mundane; for everyday tasks I prefer Racket and Factor./*      this bit of chicanery is to prevent me from     accidentally dereferencing null pointers    you might think it's ugly but would you    rather have segfault or slightly ugly code?*/// Just trying to create an array of integers for reference // because I keep forgetting how integers look like.(from here.)","0","0","0","5739991","https://i.stack.imgur.com/uXkl2.png?s=128&g=1"

Sometimes the simplest answer, even as preposterous as it seems, will be the truth. Logic is beautiful. Many key on it for determining motivation behind actions. But the bigger question is why at all? And where once I didn't believe there was anything bigger to life, now I am certain there is. We just often don't want to see it, because we're too prideful of our own skills and minds, and too worried about what we'll lose.Jesus Christ is Lord.Seek ardently and you can and will find Him.Many of my passions stem from that, whether it's answering questions in places like this, providing weather information (feel free to message me anytime for meteorological input), teaching, or just trying to make a difference.To God alone belongs every glory!","0","5","0","3645794","https://i.stack.imgur.com/eSOog.png?s=128&g=1"

I'm inspired by John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, Nikola Tesla, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs.If you need a few quotes by The Great Explainer, see below.I hate rigorous proofs, but I know they're good for me. Here's why:  The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.    Richard P. FeynmanExamples don't only improve understanding, they help validate it:  It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.    Richard P. FeynmanI'm an ignorant teen. Not to worry, for I'm a curious teen as well!  It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.    Richard P. FeynmanIf your still on first principles like I am, don't feel too bad.  If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one!    Richard P. FeynmanYou haven't lived if you can't relate to this quote:  If I get stuck, I look at a book that tells me how someone else did it. I turn the pages, and then I say, 'Oh, I forgot that bit,' then close the book and carry on. Finally, after you've figured out how to do it, you read how they did it and find out how dumb your solution is and how much more clever and efficient theirs is!    Richard P. FeynmanI study like this, too:  It's the way I study - to understand something by trying to work it out or, in other words, to understand something by creating it. Not creating it one hundred percent, of course; but taking a hint as to which direction to go but not remembering the details. These you work out for yourself.    Richard P.

I believe the key to writing good software is collaborating and thinking through the problem. After that all that's left is how you tell the computer to execute your implementation. A good software developer can turn their hand to any language once they realise that is the medium used to implement their solution.During my career so far I've built up a lot of experience working with very high volume transactional websites (at big name companies such as easyJet, Asos, Nasdaq and Play.com). This has given me valuable experience on how to write fast, maintainable and scalable code.I am a practitioner of the BDD (Behavioural Driven Development) approach where possible or at the very least a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. I don't know how people can write software without a specification or at the very least a test. Without this how do they know what they are writing their software to do? Writing, investigating and talking through the Spec(s)/test(s) first gives you a clear vision of what the software needs to do. Bolting the tests on after the fact (or in the worst case not at all) always leads to a more long winded and buggy solution.For most of my career I have worked using the Agile Scrum methodology. I really like this way of working as it gives the software team a visible achievable goal each sprint. It also allows the business to react to an ever changing market (and often requirements).","0","0","0","945810","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0681e205848365e179e6541b99e2dc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

Due to the horrible state of our ecosystem our grandchildren might be the last generation before the next mass extinction. I'm trying to use all the funds available and all the technology available to restore the ecosystem and give men an edge through cyborization of the human body. This means a lot of investment into different technologies and projects.Bitcoin is a stepping stone for our society to finally change. Decentralization of both economy and political power can bring about a sustainable environment where green cities are controlled by computer algorithms, calculating everything to work in perfect synergy.The charity I would receive from you would obviously go towards monopolization of political power and economies. Bitcoins tend to ""eat"" fiat currency and I tend to use that against the banking system. The rate of return of investments ranges from 30% to 800%. The more money the project will have - the more it can make to become self-sustainable.At this stage even a single Bitcoin is great as I used to work as a stock market analyst and have been studying the market - my plan is solid but I need more backing since there simply is no time - hence why I hardly sleep. All my personal money is in the project - everything from cloud mining to currency exchange platforms and lending to other people to get commission back. It's ironic I'm behaving like a bank now but tough times deserve tough measures.Contact me if you would be interested in being part of the project - as an investor, a specialist in one of the fields or anyone else for that matter.Peace.Hope you see I'm trying to save us all here,Sincerely,Igor Dunaev","0","0","0","8816891","https://graph.facebook.com/10153691157351500/picture?type=large"

Yes, I have degrees from both the College of Basic Sciences and from the College of Arts and Languages. Yes, I am a scientist and an artist, a fact I attribute to my maternal grandfather's book collection, to Carl Sagan's Cosmos series, and to the Voyager II and Voyager I missions that fueled the imaginations of us all and filled the National Geographic magazine during the formative years of my growing up.No, I'm not an expert in anything, merely passionately curious about everything.

""What did you expect, and what did you get?""Question-askers often say something ""doesn't work"" but forget to tell what it actually does, what they expected it to do, or both. Often, the problem is in a mistaken expectation of what should happen, or a mistaken interpretation of what did happen.In order to help them, one has to make assumptions and guess at these things, and the guesses may be off-target, resulting in an annoying waste of time for both sides.It's like Nebuchadnezzar asking for an interpretation of his dream but refusing to reveal the dream itself.

Calculus is not a branch of mathematics unto itself, but rather another application of a fully functioning analysis made useful by topology, measure theory and vital mathbf R-related properties comprising a full number field as defined by pure mathematics.Many mathematics students and professors use applications of real analysis every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the application of real analysis which is widely used today is often called ""Calculus"", and many of its users are not aware that it is merely a part of real analysis, developed by the Nicolas Bourbaki group.There really is a calculus, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the field they use. Calculus is the computation process: the set of rules and formulae that allow the mathematical mind to derive numerical formulae from other numerical formulae. The computation process is an essential part of a branch of mathematics, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete number field. Calculus is normally used in combination with the real number field, its topology and its measured space: the whole system is basically real numbers with analytical methods and properties added, or real analysis. All the so-called calculus problems are really problems of real analysis.","3","2","0","8489214","https://i.stack.imgur.com/aCQyz.png?s=128&g=1"

Currently happiest in Perl, Lisp and C/C++. Have done well writing interfaces for chess engines. Use chess as a way to learn a new (to me) language.Least I forget (and I did :) ) I started TeX-ing after returning from the 2nd West Coast Computer Faire. I spent a fair amount of time talking to a fellow hacker who was porting TeX to an 8-bit environment. Don't remember if he succeeded or not (memory may not be the first to go, but go it does) but I do remember that I owned a PDP-11/23 at that time and I believe that DECUS had a usable version. Primary problem was that this was a bit before the arrival of either Laser Printers or Postscript. But once all of the necessary ingredients were put together I fell into the land of good looking documents. I have to say that it helped that my Father-In-Law owned and used two Franklin printing presses and was kind enough to let me play---good old days indeed.","0","1","0","304006","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8abfd1e79dc3b98bb1fc1921d4d7ed9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

Things don't become true because everybody believes them, or false because no one believes them. Winston(the protagonist) insisted upon the right to assert that two plus two is four, even if everyone else is saying that it is something else. In other words, even if millions of people believe something is false and only one believes it is true, that one person is not necessarily crazy.","3","5","2","9547552","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/127845e9b5c2cae7cb678e48de6f5b41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

I guess this objective has faded with time.I love this site (SE).I'm waiting for the day this site makes a popular site worldwide, just like Wikipedia. I'm also waiting for the day 'Puzzling' becomes a full-fledged site (It's currently in Beta). It seems that this will happen soon!I offer bounties quite often. As of today (3 Nov 2015), I have 2015 2370 rep in my account and 1250 1750 rep in offered bounties on Puzzling SE.What I am known for:Simple questions which have no solution till date:Check out the list at http://meta.puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/4399/list-of-bounties-with-no-deadlines It is updated and more reliable.On Puzzling SE (I can promise a minimum 250 rep bounty for solving any of these five, or even improving on the current best score)http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/11780/sudoku-net-that-is-always-solvable (do better than 33)http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/9155/variant-of-lion-and-100-zebras (find a formal proof)http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/9875/rigged-casino-that-prevents-pairs (do better than 17)http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/10769/maximize-chains-in-a-sudoku (do better than 27)http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/10269/block-the-snake-from-reaching-points (no bounty for this one)On Math SEhttp://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1268509/how-long-does-one-remain-in-the-squarehttp://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1193615/probability-of-another-3-integers-with-same-sum-and-product-as-the-first-3-integhttp://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1129004/create-the-most-stressful-tennis-game-everSome things I would like: (Please ignore.)Total rep = Earned rep, not Total rep = Earned rep - Spent rep. Spent rep should be accounted separately so that the bounties you put equal the rep you have earned. For example, if you have earned 2000 and spent 400, your total rep is still 2000 and your leftover spending rep is 1600.2. I'd like the process of creating a new site (Private and Public Beta) to be a bit faster. I can't understand one good reason why Puzzling SE should be called a 'beta' site. Does 'beta' mean there is something missing?3. I would like the question ban on me on Meta SE to be removed. I know SE doesn't handle such requests manually, but I do believe I deserve another chance, after all, it's been over a year. Moreover, I have asked more good questions than bad on the site-specific metas.","0","10","0","4377344","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03a5a4e159e8bdc13e009eb507e916d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

And of course that igloo can only exist about 7 months of the year.  Also if you look closely you will notice the dish is at an unnatural angle for the far north.  From there, the TV satellites are right down on the southern horizon.  And of course you have to wonder where the power is coming from to light the place and run the TV.

Too many people here who likes to mock other people, harsh comments, downvoting as a sport, marking questions duplicate without reading or trying to understand what the person is really asking. A lot of people doesn't like to help other, but seems to be here to collect reputation points. Downvoting, downvoting, downvoting, and closing questions... If you are a beginner in a topic, how to avoid asking noob questions? I wonder!!! This reputation point system prevents people to be more friendly. Neutrality is a lie.The reason I still use it is that it teach me many things, because a lot of rude people, but some very specialized persons can be found here, and there's a lot to learn. It's the (very) positive side. There are some hidden treasures to learn many new things! I learned a lot.If the community (in general) was not so hostile, with a negative state of mind, it would be the perfect site.My English is not always perfect, but I try. :kof:I'm almost a polyglot able to read and write in 6 languages now, maybe a real polyglot later.

I’ve written two Shannon-type game engines in C++ (Chess Meister and NEX4), two engines in SWIFT (Chess Meister and Hnefatafl), and a MIDI enabled Music Invaders game to train musicians to read sheet music. These apps are available for the iPAD on the iTunes App Store: • Chess Meister • NEX4 • Music Invaders As an app designer, I tend to a minimalist interface — but my deeper interest is in Artificial Intelligence — and for this reason I wrote the Chess and Connect 4 engines. Currently (2018) writing a new game engine based on Hnefatafl (viking chess) in Swift. A longer term goal of creating recursive heuristic search like the MiniMax used in these engines — is developing a method for rendering light-dark interactions as described in Goethe's Theory of Colours — and creating a perceptual 3D Renderer incorporating this method.

If you think disabling IPv6 is ever the correct solution to a problem then you are part of the problem. If you ask how to disable IPv6 you can expect a downvote from me. If you suggest disabling IPv6 as a solution you can expect a downvote from me.In 2014 I applied a logistic growth model to the numbers published by Google and predicted that 2018 Sep 1 would be the first day Google saw more than 50% IPv6 traffic and 2019 Jan 18 would be the last day Google saw more than 50% IPv4 traffic.Since then IPv6 adoption has been slowing down while problems caused by IPv4 shortage has been getting much worse.Should you ever want to give me remote access to a machine, my ssh public key is:ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDM1Ot12ThbTcPOGpfh7AiRqp3P4BMm3DNo4mDg7gDFPwCmM9rKRHTH0fBVSqkSGlXm84q29bckDukg7vfqkbTpbkP3e2YmTkP6p1J2SoX2QMUnBRRgL9It/ZiAfA2I4QzUrcywVvokO1F2DqcRLy5e5wKTUFfvIm6D2QfBmGbnW2Kkpn16hQyLT1ClXjFC1qXUhazePv0cAtWUCUGjRcLr/ipOphS7eOB46cGhYqtbMkKx0t93ZG4f6jM0o32cYy3RqprpZpTmCeG1gDyG+IlSLBYXYggr72iwTKsTZ9pMDTCBQ8Pb7l317TPOcJzTtDxnpgpGE3x4Vu/Ww+zhsIeT kasperd 2014 May 24Sometimes I wonder if this xkcd comic might actually be inspired by StackExchange.","0","6","0","4248656","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94d9a0b48ed04d00d7608ffa07afebd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Bogaziçi University. Before, I worked as a Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant at Sabanci University. I was working on a System Identification Project. During my undergraduate education, my passion for robotics has made my research area be Robotics. That's why, my final year project is an Autonomous Mobile Robot using SLAM algorithms to map an unknown indoor environment. I personally define myself as a robotics enthusiast who is working hard to become a robotics scientist. The word ""working hard"" means ""try as much as you can"" for me. I always learn new things and improve my works by iteration. On each iteration, my works gets better, because I believe that the faults are tutors that teach us the right way. I've been improving myself in programming and hardware, because robotics is an interdisciplinary area. To become a scientist, I know that I must complete my graduate education in a top ranked university which has research groups in my related area, because I want to be very active with regard to Computer Vision &amp; Signal Processing research in my graduate education; that's why, I'm at Bogaziçi University.","0","0","0","3922687","https://i.stack.imgur.com/nHmU2.jpg?s=128&g=1"

I was born in Ithaca, NY, and studied biomechanical engineering and engineering physics there at Cornell, before getting my M.Sc. Applied Physics from the TU Delft in the Netherlands. I am here because I love people and I want them to excel.Most of the ideas in my answers are carefully crafted, and where they explode in complexity it is usually because I don't know a less-complex way to fully express the point. There are usually short-hand steps in the middle that I use may run over your head. If you're reading this for any reason, please feel free to ask me in comments to ""dumb down"" these sorts of details; and I will do my best. There are usually easier ways to explain special cases and stuff.So, for example, the work-energy theorem can be worked out, in a limited sense, with plain middle-school algebra: but if you know vectors and calculus, the ""differential"" form (P = dK/dt) is much easier and clearer to start with, and the work-energy theorem is just the time-integral of that. So I will tend towards the ""easy/clear"" version with vectors and calculus: but if you don't know vectors and calculus, you're going to miss out! If you are reading this because that has happened, ask me in comments for the lower-skill-level explanation, and I will try to give you that middle-school algebra version.(But, for your own good, learn vectors and calculus. It is a tragedy that people try to teach physics without some ""0th-year-course"" on those topics. In fact college courses seem to reteach the same stuff year after year at all skill levels, just because they don't want to set aside a prerequisite freshman course on the subject to teach it to everyone together.)","2","2","0","838779","https://i.stack.imgur.com/BEj4h.png?s=128&g=1"

To me, a  good software system should be able to respond quickly to rapidly changing requirements without any sacrifice of quality and robustness. Design and automation are keys to achieve this goal: thoughtful upfront system design makes software easier to extend and maintain whereas automation is essential to eliminate defects that are inherent in any complex system. But my quest has not finished yet: Functional Programming paradigm has taught me why current state-of-the-art of software development produces fragile systems. Continuous study in functional languages such as erlang and ocaml brings me both joy of learning and practical insight into building better software.","0","0","0","23249","https://i.stack.imgur.com/MBBRu.jpg?s=128&g=1"

My mathematical skills are rather pedestrian, with a rare insight every now and then. I have been lucky enough to sit in the same room with some famous mathematicians &amp; engineers. My Erdõs number is 5, which undoubtedly makes me as unique as an Irishman in a pub. And I have been spotted in The Pub from time to time.In professional circumstances, my value add has usually been the injection of common sense and completion of grunt work when perspectives and energies are unfocused. My current age is the number of leaves of a shamrock multiplied by the number of angels guarding hell.My real name is Joe Higgins. Apparently, my last name means 'of the Viking' in Irish. My alma mater is University College, Cork in Ireland, and I had the additional privilege of obtaining my Phd. in EECS from the University of California at Berkeley under the enlightened tutelage of Lucien Polak.I can be reached at joe dot higgins at gmail dot com.The little picture is of my tent at Lake Helen on the beautiful Mount Shasta in August, 2009. Unfortunately I had to turn back near the peak this time (on the appropriately named Misery Hill) because of a lightning storm which dumped someunexpected snow. The nearby lightning caused my ice axe to hum and a strange bee-likebuzzing sound in my hair! Very entertaining.Feynman used to say, ""physics is to sex as mathematics is to masturbation"".To cheer you up, AE Housman wrote that     ""Perfect understanding will sometimes almost extinguish pleasure.""I like Rockafellar's line: ""This classical result is an outstanding example of a fact which is completely obvious to geometric intuition, but which wields important algebraic content and is not trivial to prove.""

Dog owner.Useful questions and answers on the StackExchange network (short list at the moment..):Syntax highlighting in code blocksEasily change the size of imagesHere is another short list, a list of pet peeves I have collected on Stack Overflow and related websites:SI unitsTo avoid ambiguities, there is a general consensus on how to format physical units. Please try to follow them, it helps the flow when reading, and it helps when trying to understand exactly what you are talking about. The official guidelines are offered in chapter 5 of the SI brochure, but there is a summary with a couple of examples on Wikipedia.A particular problem is the space between the value and the unit, for example: 12&#8239;V, not 12V. A common hack is to use the non-breaking space, &amp;nbsp;, to prevent the browser wrapping the line between the value and the unit. The problem with &amp;nbsp; is that it is often interpreted as a fixed width space, meaning that it will not render as the same width as a normal space, but wider. Unicode has solved this problem by introducing the NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE symbol, &amp;#8239;.My recommendation is that you use &amp;#8239; to format SI units. This difference may or may not be visible in your browser:12 V (normal space)12&nbsp;V (&amp;nbsp;)12&#8239;V (&amp;#8239;)""I'm in Europe.""This means nothing. Nothing at all to anyone trying to help you with a question you might have. Either write your country, or just leave it out - There's a world of difference (literally) between Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania, United Kingdom and Iceland. Different laws, different business structures, different traditions, different standards. The same goes for Asia.Leaving out your country means that you will not get help with questions such as:Is this legal?Where can I buy things?","0","5","0","7306058","https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKaUq.png?s=128&g=1"

I have completed a masters degree in Botany around 2015. I've submitted a proposal on AREA-51 for SE site on Bangla (=Bengali) language. Right now it's starred (*). I.e. if does not get 5 follows within 3 days of creation; it will be deleted. However it will take a long journey (many more supports) to make it successful. Enthusiast please support us by following the proposal or/and submitting good-questions.   UPDATE: !   PSST  !The proposal of an SE about Bangla (=Bengali (in Eng.) ) language did not received enough follow within 3 days; so it has been deleted by system. I'll again propose the site in indefinite future (not right now because I'm very busy); but If in the mean time anyone else want to take the initiative; they will get the support from me as much as possible for me staying within SE network and not hampering my anyother works. So the site won't be duplicated. If anyone wish; go ahead. On that issue; my recommendation/opinion is; beside grammar and literature (mainstream things); typing and software-rendering related questions could be put under the same umbrella; because typing/software related problems are associated with its users or application. However othes' opinion would matter. If SE network do-not have enough server-memory; they may think about expanding and improving that in future. Though it is quite impractical to include all Indian languages under the same proposal ""Indian languages""; it too should be re-opened for  the general aspects. UPDATE: At some point at 2017 I have lost the backup copy of questions published in proposed Bengali language SE network; completely accidentally, after a system crash. I'm sory for this inconvenience. Up to my recall, there was probably only one question by another user (other than me) pen-named ""Ankoganit"" who asked if the letter ""<U+098B>"" is pronounced as ""R+i"", then why it is classified traditionally as vowel instead of consonant. Other questions were by me, and probably I would be able to recall them gradually. ","1","6","0","8307233","https://i.stack.imgur.com/dns0q.png?s=128&g=1"

(Beta available here--free, ad-free, purchase free and collects no data. &lt;10MB on Android!)  Currently architecting a set of pure strategies that can be combined to produce automata with a range of strengths and inclination for vs. human play.  *(Eventually we'll utilize a deep learning model for pure strength, but the initial goal is to pursue a ""strategy ladder"" AI approach to facilitate human learning.  The game is suitable for ages 5+, so AIs that are weak in meaningful ways are useful, such as the random player which 5 year-olds can beat.)

I've written an international best-selling book of the same title (Fluent in 3 Months) and published courses with John Murray learning, collectively known as #languagehacking.My background is actually in Electronic Engineering, but I got into language learning during my 13 years on the road before I moved to New York. My extensive travels led to National Geographic giving me the title of ""Traveler of the Year"". I speak around 10 languages, depending on where your cut-off point is. If that point is lower-intermediate, or CEFR level B1 is a starting point, then 11 is the number I'd go for. This is ""conversational"" level where I can speak with a native about a good range of topics if he/she is patient and used to speaking with a foreigner. If the point is ""fluency"" where I can function at normal speed in pretty much all social situations without hindering communication (upper intermediate, or B2), then it's 6. If the point is ""mastery"", where I could work as an engineer in the language, as I would in English, then it's 3. I consider this level overkill, so I don't push towards it in most of my languages.Video is a big passion of mine, and you can see me publish on my YouTube channel very often. I like experimenting with live videos and am getting back into gaming, via live streaming.My YouTube channel and twitter are verified, and I'm active across many other social media channels. I act as a consultant to language/technology firms and enjoy speaking at universities and conferences on various topics.","0","0","0","10898751","https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1mjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1"

I am mainly a front-end web developer, but I love programming many languages for many uses. I'm primarily versed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, and C. I dabble in shell scripting a bit, and like making interesting programs and scripts for the joy of it. I'm also a very big fan of Code Wars–coding exercises are a blast!Aside from programming, I'm a musician making primarily electronic music and indie rock. I'm a huge Go/Baduk/Weiqi fanatic as well. I enjoy contributing to Stack Overflow in whatever ways I can and try to remain humble as I explore the world of programming and the talented coders therein.","0","2","0","254769","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aa477396ffe6a51e547107c5032d4399?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

In early 2014, I put together a short series of expository videos on Ramsey theory that can be viewed here (produced and published by my good friend Eddie Beck).I'm active primarily in the point-set topology and various abstract algebra tags. Here's a sampling of my more valuable contributions to this site:Finding primitive elements for finite extensions of $mathbb{Q}$: a Galois-theoretic techniqueConstructing connected spaces with arbitrarily many path componentsOn symmetric polynomialsA simple application of the Banach fixed-point theoremFinding Galois groups $cong S_n$ via generating sets: an exampleVisualizing ring homomorphisms The intersection of two compact sets need not be compactA continuous function $f:[a,b] to mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrableQuotient spaces are ill-behaved with respect to separation axioms The box topology on infinite products: problems with continuity The Galois group of an irreducible, rational, cubic polynomial is determined by its discriminantA one-point connectification of any topological spaceProving that closed &amp; open subsets of locally compact Hausdorff spaces are locally compact—without too much machineryFriendly logarithms: Example 1, Example 2, Example 3Outside of math, I am interested in existentialism, Christianity, and exploring the nature of consciousness.  I also hold music in the highest regard. I listen to a wide variety of genres, from minimalist / ambient to electronic to psychedelic rock to heavy metal and more--with a soft spot for death metal. I play several brass instruments and am currently setting aside some time every day learning to play &amp; improvise on trumpet.If you want to connect with me elsewhere, I play chess here under the username Kaj_Hansen and Starcraft II as MementoMori. Feel free to add me.In addition to Math.SE, I'm an avid reader of, and regular contributor to, the Wikipedia project.  ","6","2","0","4240651","https://i.stack.imgur.com/klR4W.png?s=128&g=1"

Programming is somewhat of a family business to me. Every one of the kids of my Great-Gramps ended up in IT sooner or later, with several of their sons and daughters also joining the IT fray in one form or another. My grandfather was the one that inspired me to join software development and taught me how to develop systems for DBASE III when I was really little, and since them I've been doing software both as a hobby and as a job. I went trough college for Computer Science and started working on the field as an intern on the same semester I hit college, doing a lot of advanced math work that honestly shouldn't have been given to an intern. I learned that college wouldn't really prepare me better than real-life experiences on the my field, so I started learning every single thing I could for everyone I worked with - my peers, my bosses, colleagues from different departments... I found out that I love to learn stuff, and I strive to learn at least one new thing every day.I also have around 10 years of Dungeon Mastering experience - mostly with d20 systems, especially D&amp;D 3.X and Pathfinder. Currently, I'm running a Shadowrun game every other week using mostly skype to conduct my games. I'm also a long time gamer and World of Wacraft/Starbound player.","0","0","0","3053195","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pP7zIv0JUfA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACE/EbFZExanNqE/photo.jpg?sz=128"

That being said...I believe that TDD/CI/DevOps are the best strategies to develop maintainable, robust, working software. They also happen to help develop your software quickly, especially if you're working in a team (which most of us are). I've been lucky to work with everything from a 20M line legacy baseline all the way down to greenfield projects, and a plethora of things in between. I have yet to find a better strategy for creating maintainable/robust software, and furthermore creating it quickly/efficiently with a large team of developers, but I'm all ears if you've got a better one! I'll admit when you first hear of TDD, it sounds like some moronic exercise in pedantry. It isn't. It's really effective for design and maintainability. Don't knock it until you actually try it!!! Please understand you don't get a team to convert to these strategies in a day: it takes time, patience, effort, and sometimes a culture change. Maybe it's not worth it for your org or software product: and that's totally fine. They are all long term strategies, not short term ones.Lehigh University Alum. B.S. in math, 2014. M.S.

It's hard to keep coming up with new ways to phrase the same tired old information.I was born 12 October 1950.  I discovered science fiction before I was out of elementary school.  I have been reading constantly since I was seven.  I haven't stopped yet.  I discovered science fiction fandom and found out that they weren't publishing this entire genre of fiction just for me ... though it felt like it at times.I'm gay, out, proud, and weird as you can be and still not be locked up.  I've recently -- within the last five years -- acknowledged that I'm a transgirl who is currently undergoing Hormone Replacement Therapy.  Gay, trans, pretty much asexual but gayromantic, androgynous, and a few more categories that never fit comfortably.  I like hypnosis and have several files available on http://www.WarpMyMind.com.  I also have multiple personalities, which causes all sorts of problems with pronouns.  Besides the ordinary male/female problems with pronouns, I also have singular v. plural problems.  Several of my hypnosis files were written to cause others who wanted another personality or two to have their wish granted.  Another was written to cause people to shrink in height.  Yes, it works. This reality is extremely malleable.  One guy -- I wrote a special version of my Shrinking file for him -- shrank from almost five feet seven inches to three feet five inches, a twenty-five-inch difference.  I also love various mythologies.  I am, of course, pagan.  I mortgaged my soul a few decades ago. I'm sure I got the best of that deal.","5","0","0","10276088","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gnT3696h2zg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAxA/g5iqPamXVpQ/photo.jpg?sz=128"

The pure act of Typing is just materializing of what has been thought. Of course, there is a bidirectional feedback connection between writing and thinking. At least for introverts; dunno about extroverts :) And given that, I disagree with @MisterPositive: Of course the typing part needs to be paid, too - a master stone sculptor gets not only paid for planning the sculpture, but also for liberating the sculpture from the stone.-- in reply to https://workplace.stackexchange.com/a/98823/13093  Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners. Bubble-Bursting read/blog: https://crazyegg.com/blog/ugly-website-design .    Also: I really recommend to strike ""why don't they use X, yet"", ""why do they still use X"" and all variants thereof (regex: (still|allready)?.*(use|using).*(yet)?) from your list of idioms. I always get frightened when hearing that, because it's often enough a red flag indicating blind faith in something. ""Yo brother, work for us, we're already using .net, you know"" was something I heard quite often 10 years ago. It sounded like they seriously believed that .net was the One True Thing to use.

I haven't gotten really serious until Spring 2012, where I found a couple students at college that played yugioh and taught me a bunch of the rulesJust recently started Magic the Gathering in winter of 2016. I got a deck from a friend at church that is a red/white deck that runs heavily on creatures' heroic abilities and a mono red deck that I put together from scratch.I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since July 12, 2015, found by Sister Paw and Sister Foster and was baptized by my friend Louie Lozano, a returning missionary who I have known since we were in 5th grade. Since then, I’ve met many great people while attending church every Sunday and building a testimony that my redeemer lives. I go to church every Sunday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. and visit several wards (I still say Santa Gertrudes Ward is one the best wards ever, despite being the Mar Vista YSA Ward in Granada Ward boundaries).June 5, 2016, I was sustained to Melchizedek Priest to the office of an Elder, and one week later on June 12, 2016, was ordained by Adam Dunford. Can’t believe I’ve made it this far! While going to church every week, I learn a lot about myself and grown to be so different from who I was 2 years ago. I was called as one of two Gospel Essentials teachers a year ago and have enjoyed working with students and learned so much about the Gospel in the process.","0","0","0","10319192","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fX4MlXQjwak/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC4/q6y26OqCVI0/photo.jpg?sz=128"

I work with some great people on an innovative, lean team. I love how we have the flexibility to try out just about any new programming/devops technologies as we see fit to meet the customers' needs.

I guess sometimes a hobby is just a hobby.  I've been programming on and off since I was 14, when I ran a multiplayer Moparscape server written in Java. At the time though, I didn't even know what language I was using. I managed to reverse engineer existing code to learn how to create new things. It's 10 years later now, and I know 9ish languages. Right now though I'm focusing on Clojure because it's just a fantastic language. Unfortunately, I have very little, if any experience with frameworks. Since I'm just a hobbyist, I've always found it more rewarding to do everything ""the hard way"". I can be reached at brendonw5@gmail.com if you need any help that's beyond the scope of this site. I love a good puzzle.[My avatars are generated using a Mandelbrot Set Explorer I wrote in Clojure. See my GitHub!]","0","0","0","3595277","https://i.stack.imgur.com/C9Fxi.jpg?s=128&g=1"

My biggest program completed to date (as of late Feb 2017) is a simulator of a Major League Baseball season based on runs scored/allowed and remaining opponents.  It's non-bayesian, unfortunately, and also is very ugly C++ from my ""OO is everything"" days.HOBBIES:Video games, Chess, roguelikes, bowling, golf (latter two when my back allows).  I used to be insanely into Pokémon but am much less so now.  I also enjoy jigsaw puzzles and cats.  Former MtG enthusiast.OTHER:I have a constant headache and a Psyduck keychain to go with it.  It's a mix of sinus and migraine and whatever you're about to suggest I've tried it already.  (Chamomile tea has been effective at reducing sensitivity to light and sound.)  This also means I nap a lot and keep an irregular sleep schedule.","0","0","0","6946144","https://graph.facebook.com/246498755809969/picture?type=large"

(More detailed info on my accent below.)I’m especially interested in questions about pronunciation, whether it's phonology, phonetics or orthoëpy. I find it hard to think of questions, but I find seeing other people's questions and searching for the answers is a great way to learn. And of course, I've also learned a lot from the answers posted by other users.Please let me know if you see anything incorrect in my posts!MY ACCENT:“Caught” and “cot” are homophones“orange” has the same vowel as “core”; the only words spelled with “or” that have the “far” vowel /<U+0251>r/ for me are sorry, tomorrow, borrow, sorrow I don’t naturally have /<U+028A>r/: in the pronunciations I acquired as a child, “poor” and “tour” have the same vowel as “core,” while ""cure” and “lure” have the same vowel as “fur”“long a” (/e~e<U+026A>/) before /l/ doesn't have a high offglide; instead, it's something like [e<U+0259><U+032F>] (similar to the vowel in “hair” without the final “r”) “short a” before /m/, /n/ or /<U+014B>/ is always fronted and raised to something like [e~<U+0259><U+032F>] (similar to the vowel in “hair” without the final “r”)the vowel in “strength” and “length”  may sometimes approach the vowel in “bang”QUOTATIONS ABOUT LANGUAGE:  “A degree of versatility seems involved in the very nature of language, and is one of those evils left by Providence for man to correct : a love of order, and the utility of regularity, will always incline him to confine this versatility within as narrow bounds as possible.” –John Walker  “Variability is not some pesky defect of  languages, but a central feature of them (along with, at least,  opposition, compositionality, redundancy, ambiguity,  synonymy/paraphrase, and hierarchical structure—plus, of course,  shared norms).  Language (both spoken and written) varies from person  to person, from social group to social group, from occasion to  occasion, and even for a single person on a single occasion, from  moment to moment.  And this is a very good thing.  It would be insane  to try to enforce a single choice between variants, on all occasions,  for everyone.” –Arnold Zwicky  “Your lexicographer, having written his dictionary, comes to be considered as ‘one having authority,’ whereas his function is only to make a record, not to give a law. The natural servility of the human understanding having invested him with judicial power, surrenders its right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statute.” –Ambrose Bierce","0","2","0","4518647","https://i.stack.imgur.com/CAyPr.gif?s=128&g=1"

Studying for 4 A levels, running my own freelance writing business and working an additional job on the side means that programming is mainly done within the confines of my A - Level coursework I am a Raspberry Pi enthusiast although my projects completed statistic is in single figures at the moment.Anyway, that basically sums it up about me, if you bothered to read to the end, thank you :)","0","1","0","12007967","https://i.stack.imgur.com/65bJA.jpg?s=128&g=1"

Quand j’ai commencé l’étude de l’homme, j’ai vu que ces sciences abstraites ne sont pas propres a l’homme, et que je m’égarais plus de ma condition en y pénétrant que les autres en l’ignorant. J’ai pardonné aux autres d’y peu savoir, mais j’ai cru trouver au moins bien des compagnons en l’étude de l’homme et que c’est le vrai étude qui lui est propre. J’ai été trompé. Il y en a encore moins qui l’étudient que la géométrie. Ce n’est que manque de savoir étudier cela qu’on cherche le reste. Mais n’est-ce pas que ce n’est pas encore la la science que l’homme doit avoir, et qu’il lui est meilleur de s’ignorer pour etre heureux.-- Pascal (Pensées, Lafuma 687 = Brunschwicg 144)","0","6","0","2959532",NA

After more years spent with web apps, I started using more advanced back-end and front-end, on the back-end I developed apps for Azure using Azure SDKs (such as the Service Fabric and the Service bus). And on the front-end side I used frameworks and languages such as Bootstrap, Angular and Typescript.Starting in 2017, I got more involved in architectural challenges and tasks, supporting DevOps and the automation team, and started leading and training other team members.","0","2","0","8579469","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c06f0759a0d9a9df970063a6d2aa1557?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

It would be helpful if you composed a fully compilable [MWE](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228/4301) including `documentclass` and the appropriate packages that sets up the problem. While solving problems can be fun, setting them up is not. Then, those trying to help can simply cut and paste your MWE and get started on solving the problem.It is always best to compose a fully compilable [MWE](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228/4301) that illustrates the problem including the `documentclass` and the appropriate packages so that those trying to help don't have to recreate it.This will also serve as a test case and ensure that the solution actually works for you.That way those trying to help can focus on the solution as opposed to setting up the problem test case.While code snippets are useful in explanations, it is always best to compose a fully compilable [MWE](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228/4301) that illustrates the problem including the `documentclass` and the appropriate packages so that those trying to help don't have to recreate it.This is especially important for `tikz` as there are numerous libraries.Also, the solution may be dependent on the packages that you are using.In this case it will actually help to ensure that the solution actually solves your specific problem.Personally, I have often solved my own problems in the process of reducing the amount of code actually required to reproduce the problem.A tip: If you indent lines by 4 spaces, then they're marked as a code sample. You can also highlight the code and click the ""code"" button (`{}`).I took the liberty to format your post a little. See [this link for more details on available formatting](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/editing-help).Saying it ""does not work"" does not provide any useful information with which anyone can provide you with any help. I'd suggest you post a new question and include a fully compilable [MWE](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228/4301) including `documentclass` and the appropriate packages that sets up the problem. If your case does not even compile, then ensure that it compiles if that one line is commented.  While solving problems can be fun, setting them up is not. Then, those trying to help can simply cut and paste your MWE and get started on solving the problem.If the solution worked for you please see [How do you accept an answer?](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1852/how-do-you-accept-an-answer) and perhaps [How does accepting an answer work?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work).Please see [why should the `minimal` class be avoided?](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42114/why-should-the-minimal-class-be-avoided).","0","0","0","411343","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8dd59f76caa3a12e11f215126b8c118?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

Microsoft, very possibly the cash-richest corporation in human history, can afford to keep ""classic"" interfaces and options as well as whatever unproductive changes that they deem that novices (or anyone else) might prefer - in THEIR JUDGMENT. (By the way, this is not about ""not liking the ribbon"" - although the concomitant removal of the menu user interface in Office was the most technologically destructive move in the history of science.)I write software and create spreadsheets and work output with the intent that every user or maintainer is pleased with what I gave them to work with. I stay until 11PM if I can tweak more clarity, faster performance, enhanced interface, better documentation, or anything else that I think of, to make my work product more satisfying to recipients, and I go to bed with no regrets of my contribution to society each day.  This is in sharp contrast to what I perceive to be the Microsoft work effort. What they produce suggests that they rather grab their surfboard or X-Boxes at 5:00 each day. Of course, time is always carved out for interviews in tech media, where the ""wunderkids"" and ""brilliant nerds"" are prima-donnaed despite their true unworthiness.So you came here because of the bizarre username. Okay. Funny - it would not exist, had Microsoft not economically slayed its superior competitors along the road.

I personally enjoy code golf because it's basically one large test case for a language I make. After all, I believe a language is only as good as it can be short. (Thus Java often falls out of favor with me...)Similarly, I heavily enjoy obfuscation. It's an expression of the mastery that one has in a language, and an art form in itself.When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing video games (TF2 is love, TF2 is life), writing, reading, or (gasp) socializing within what semblance of a social life I have.About me, I'm a Christian teenager, proud to be serving my God. I do what I can to let people know there is a God who loves them, without stepping on people's toes.

The argument goes something like this: ""I refuse to prove that I exist,'"" says God, ""for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.""  ""But,"" says Man, ""The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.""  ""Oh dear,"" says God, ""I hadn't thought of that,"" and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.  ""Oh, that was easy,"" says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.”An excerpt from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, copy-pasted from the internet. The worst book ever writtenis my high school computer science textbook, because there’s something funny at every page turn and most of it doesn’t make sense.  The third algorithm use two loops the second inside the first (nested loops (quadratic algorithm-quadratic time required)).A direct quote, I believe. Page 233.   [...] In the Java programming language the float primitive data type ranges from 1.4-45 to 3.438 The way this is phrased will cause an entire generation of java programmers to think that floats can't store negative values.

Escher's Cirkellimiet IV (1960), or ""Circle Limit IV"". Escher's circle limit series is characterized by figures that disappear in endless, infinitely small shapes towards the edges. The circle limits are so-called tessellations, in which the visual contents of the work interlock in intriguing ways and seamlessly fill up the image. This work also represents a well-known visual illusion, namely that of an ambiguous fore and background. At first glance, it looks like a bunch off bats, but upon closer inspection it appears that angels and devils go hand in hand in this work. Escher's works are illusionary master pieces that trick our visual systems in perceiving things that cannot be. Behind the great achievements of a Gauss or an Einstein is in all cases a life devoted to contemplation, curiosity, collaboration and, perhaps most of all, hard work.(Burrell, D. Sci Am, September 2015).For what it's worth: My name is not Alice, my last name starts with an 'S', I'm a bloke and, like Escher, I just like to toy with people's perceptions :) Just say 'AliceD' out loud and likely you'll get some acid associations","0","1","0","5235324","https://i.stack.imgur.com/ywOyh.jpg?s=128&g=1"

I like to surround myself with people quite similar to me that are reliable and are used to fulfill their commitments. I’m open-minded and I don’t surrender to life difficulties, because that’s what I’ve learned from my family, one of the pillars of my happiness.Furthermore I like the idea to start studying a new language, improving what you know, I deeply think that is very important to improve yourself. Next to my professional life, my social life is very important. I really enjoy going out with my friends.I like travelling, playing saxo, reading and I also practice sports like soccer, table-tennis, fitness and cycling.

I am very interested in philosophy and logic. Most recently I have finished a graduate level course on logic in computer science where we explored topics such as Mu Calculus, Horn Formulas, and Descriptive Complexity. By day, I am currently working on an application using Javascript + Node.js. I also have professional experience with Ruby on Rails. When needed, I do some basic SQL and Html/CSS Work. I love helping others, especially when the help is used to help others learn how to code. I also hope that spending some time on here will help improve my daily skills by keeping me informed of new topics and by revisiting certain basics I may have forgotten about.","0","0","0","7118206","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50b9ab14ab8699a3862c14ee48126abe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"

Melodies flow around my head almost all the time.My influences range from Jazz to Classical, country to metal; in short, any music that has a good melody and outstanding lyrics and vocals make me fall into a deep trance.I was initially a guitarist, but eventually am trying to explore the world of vocals and how they affect the human emotion. Lately I have also ventured into the world of Electronic Music.My favourite bands/artists are Poets of the Fall, Megadeth, Rise Against, The Rasmus, Zedd, Seven Lions, to name a few.I just love the voice of Marko Saaresto(Poets of the Fall).My influences on the guitar are Buckethead, Marty Friedman, Chris Poland, Paul Gilbert, Brian May; I admire Guthrie Govan, Shawn Lane, Jason Becker, John Petrucci, Yngwie Malmsteen and David Gilmour.","0","0","0","13638734","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tE6aB2VWVgE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/_0zehs2bmgE/photo.jpg?sz=128"

In my personal life, I tried to use different frameworks and languages such as Laravel (with MySQL), Django (with SQLite), Nodejs (with MongoDB and Expressjs) to create some hello world, blog and rest API web applications. It is impossible to ignore tons of tutorials, documents, and QAs on the internet which helps you learn faster what you don't know. I like playing video games, chess, and football.

I can most easily be reached in real time by pinging me in the ELU chatroom.I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of Programming Perl and Perl Cookbook from O’Reilly. I work for Grant Street Group, who are always looking to hire more Perl programmers. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old O’Reilly bio from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up a silly Wikipedia page about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from Gary Gygax of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.The maxim that “If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet” applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.","0","0","0","216196","https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSlyx.gif?s=128&g=1"

Solving problems using algorithms... I fell in love with it.

As my academic courses and self-improvement tasks fluctuated from one extreme to another, it helped me expand my acceptance towards different states of mind. I started seeing problems as programmable configurations, and started visualizing the computer systems and patterns of different problems to be like algorithms of various complexities. This inspired me to improve my own efficiency by using time management tools, and so I was eventually able to take out time for hobbies like drawing, 3D modeling(blender), animation and game designing. As I am studying the basic computer science subjects, my curiosity grew about how minds work and whether it can be related computationally.FutureMachine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality are the future of this Technology driven world. I am currently studying about these topics and i think these are going to be best assets for my future jobs.","0","0","0","9288474","https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aaf26c2474daa4a1949100d4531046bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"

I defend Capitalism (right to property, privatization, free market) &amp; individualism (right to self-ownership, freedom of association, self-organization), research into Constitutionalism (check &amp; balance, procedure, rules of order). I advocate that governments should be small &amp; then strong. My platform: 1 separate China into independent democracies (eg. Formosa, Tibet, East Turkistan, Hong Kong, the Federation of Sc, etc.); 2 parliamentarism + proportional representation (lower House) + relative majority (upper House) + federalism. Vocation: politician. I’m for Pax Americana; I’m for 10% flat tax (including negative income tax); I’m for the right to keep &amp; bear arms; I’m for family diversity, polyamory, limited liability family, &amp; civil union; legalize prostitution; decriminalize drugs (I personally stick by a tobacco-free &amp; alcohol-free lifestyle, regardless of I’m pressed otherwise), it is negative externalities that are public problems, eg. infections, passive smoking, which is absolutely unbearable. I’m against Communism (I’m independent of the illegitimate regime, &amp; I haven’t joined the Communist Party or the Youth League or the Young Pioneers; but I wore the red scarf occasionally when I was a schoolboy, which I feel deeply ashamed of); I’m against Confucianism (on the other hand, Confucianism has already lost influence); deny “Chinese nation”/“Zhonghua Minzu”; I’m against historical determinism; I’m against “animal rights”; I’m against environmentalism; I’m against reductionism. As for UK: I’m pro-Brexit. As for US: I supported Marco Rubio &amp; recognize Donald Trump in the 58th presidential election; I’m against term limits for Congress, while I’m for age limits. I like STEM (I’m a B.Sc.), but I don’t favour scientism; I learnt linguistics &amp; philosophy; I have little interest in arts, but I don’t undervalue them, in contrast, I enjoy The Story of the Stone. I belong to no religion, despite the fact that I’ve studied a few Buddhist sutras; moreover, I reject witchcrafts; I believed in &amp; boned up Daojia. I’m open-minded &amp; evolving. I lack the ability to think on my feet, while I’m adept at long-term strategic planning; I’m a slowpoke with a heavy defensive mentality; I prefer working behind the scenes rather than performing on stage. I’ve been playing PC games since 1996. I have talent &amp; enthusiasm for designing rules of “games” – not merely video games, but also political “games”. Email: xiyanzi23@gmail.com or xiyanzi23@163.com . My ID is “XiYanZi” on Twitter, Quora, blogspot, zhihu, douban, Weibo, etc. (My WeChat is “XiYanZi23”.) Phone: +86 18702366103. I not only stutter (I never mind others making fun of me), but glow &amp; perspire when talking, eating, walking, etc. My name is Zhang Jian ([t<U+0282><U+0251><U+014B>55] [t<U+0255>ian51]); XiYanZi ([<U+0255>i55] [jan35] [tsi214]) derives from Verse 23 of Laozi","12","3","0","12790781","https://i.stack.imgur.com/bGxD9.jpg?s=128&g=1"
